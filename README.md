# Online Calculator App

This is a calculator that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I envisioned a futuristic theme/design that was user-friendly with a responsive interface. It has been built and tested to withstand any expected arithmatic errors. 


## Instructions
To use this calculator, simply follow these steps:

- Click on the button corresponding with the value you would like to input, whether that be a number or an operator.

- Ensure you abide by the rules of arithmatic. Examples being:
	- Don't divide by 0 (Zero)
	- Don't add multiple decimals to one number value

- Once you have typed the expression you want evaluated, hit the enter key

- NOTE: You can also use these keyboard shortcuts:
	- Keys "0-9" = Numbers "0-9" respectively
	- "C" key = Clear
	- Keys "=", "Enter"/"Return" = Evaluate (Equals button (=))
	- 
	- Keys "CTRL + R" = Resets page in case you run into any problems
