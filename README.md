# Online Calculator App

This is a calculator that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I envisioned a futuristic theme/design that was user-friendly with a responsive interface. It has been built and tested to withstand any expected arithmatic errors.

## Instructions

To use this calculator, simply follow these steps:

- Click on the button corresponding with the value you would like to input, whether that be a number or an operator.

- Ensure you abide by the rules of arithmatic. Examples being:

  - Don't divide by 0 (Zero)
  - Don't add multiple decimals to one number value


- NOTE: You can also use these keyboard shortcuts:
